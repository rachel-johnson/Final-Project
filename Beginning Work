I uploaded jeffblackadar's files for 1960-1999 and 1901-1911 to Overview
I browsed through the 1960-1999 files for mentions of Norway Bay
I then browsed through the 1901-1911 files for Norway Bay
I decided to use the 1901-1911 files as I am interested in looking at an early stage of the community and Shawville's perspective of it
Based on a first quick look, I lot of the entries refer to Norway Bay for funerals and land sale/development
