I looked through some newspapers which mentioned Norway Bay to see if anything stood out to me
I noticed a couple stories about the Scobie House and looked into that a little more
I realized I needed some data in the form of numbers to sonify it with musicalgorithms
I played around with the different Overview settings and found the 'Entities' feature
I used this to look at the countries mentioned in 552 documents from 1901-1911
I then copied the numbers for each country (word count and number of documents it appears in) into an excel spreadsheet
I then formatted it to be two different horizontal rows, to work with musicalgorithms
