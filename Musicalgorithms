I tried to load my csv of the Countries mentioned in the Equity between 1901-1911 into Musical Algorithms
For some reason it wouldn't load, and I double checked that everything was formatted correctly
I instead inputted the data by hand and was able to create music with it
I played around with the different instruments and found one composition I liked, I then saved the MIDI file
