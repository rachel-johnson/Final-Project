I realized that the data which Overview had given me about the countries mentioned in the Equity didn't really answer any questions
It was all randomly bunched together and didn't give me any insight that could be understood through sonification
I decided to return to my original idea of looking at how many times the Equity mentioned Norway Bay
Of the 552 newspapers between 1901-1911, 123 of them mentioned Norway Bay
I then copied down the dates which it was mentioned into a spreadsheet, set up into three columns for Year, Month, Date
I formatted them in Notepad++ and placed them into Musicalgorithms 
I realized that the years had to be represented as 1,2,3, etc... instead of 1901, 1902, 1903, etc... in order to be converted into music
I inputed all three sets of data, the year, the month, and the date from each newspaper that mentioned Norway Bay, as separete voices
I found that you could really hear the differences in frequency that the Equity mentioned Norway Bay 
The sonification truly lets the relationships between the word and the dates become apparent
